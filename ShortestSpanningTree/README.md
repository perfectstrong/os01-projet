# ElectricNetwork
Shortest spanning tree

Apply in case of constructing electric network, knowing the position of every house and maximum distances.

***input\_\<number of houses\>\_\<maximum X\>\_\<maximum Y\>.txt***: test cases generated by **Generator**
* First line contains N: number of houses (points)
* Second line contains 2 numbers corresponding to **maximum X** and **maximum Y**
* After that, each line contains 2 numbers representing **(x, y)** of each house.

***output\_\<number of houses\>\_\<maximum X\>\_\<maximum Y\>.txt***: solution found
* First line contains the minimum total length
* After that, each line contains coordinates of starting point **(x1, y1)** and ending point **(x2, y2)** respectively of a branch.

Images in _img_ folder in **Test** will visualize those results. You can rerun _Test\main.m_ in MATLAB to check result.
